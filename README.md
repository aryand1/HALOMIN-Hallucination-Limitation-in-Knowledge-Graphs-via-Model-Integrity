# 🚀 Minimize Hallucination in NLP Models 🧠✨

Welcome to the **Minimize Hallucination** project! This repository is your ultimate guide to reducing hallucinations in Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, ensuring more reliable and accurate AI-generated content. Dive into the world of AI with cutting-edge techniques and tools!

## 🌟 Project Highlights

Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, while incredibly powerful, can sometimes generate content that deviates from factual accuracy, known as "hallucination." This project focuses on minimizing such hallucinations using state-of-the-art techniques and embeddings from models like BERT, RoBERTa, and OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002.

## 📂 Repository Contents

- 📘 `Minimize_Hallucination.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code and methodologies used to minimize hallucinations in NLP models.

## 🔧 Installation Guide

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Minimize_Hallucination.git
   ```
2. **Install the Required Packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 📝 How to Use

1. **Set Up OpenAI API Key**:
   Ensure you have your OpenAI API key set up in the environment:
   ```python
   openai.api_key = 'your-api-key-here'
   ```

2. **Run the Notebook**:
   Open and execute the `Minimize_Hallucination.ipynb` notebook to explore hallucination minimization techniques in action.

## 📊 Features & Capabilities

- 🔍 **Advanced Embedding Techniques**: Leveraging BERT, RoBERTa, and OpenAI embeddings for precise text analysis.
- 📐 **Cosine Similarity Calculations**: Measure and compare the semantic similarity between different text components.
